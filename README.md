      <h1>💻 LapGenius</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>LapGenius</strong> is a mobile Android application created to assist users in making smarter decisions when purchasing used laptops, particularly in the Bosnia and Herzegovina market.
        The application automatically retrieves listings from <strong>OLX.ba</strong> and uses artificial intelligence to generate detailed, easy-to-understand reviews based on hardware specifications, price, usage scenarios and visual information.
        <br><br>
        The core motivation behind LapGenius was to simplify a process that is usually time-consuming, filled with guesswork, and difficult for non-technical users.
        Through structured evaluation, side-by-side comparisons, personalized scoring and a simple credit system, the app guides users in selecting a laptop that fits their actual needs, whether it be for studying, working, gaming or everyday browsing.
        <br><br>
        I built LapGenius as part of my academic journey, and it stands as the seventh and most complex project I have developed yet.
        It reflects months of development, design and refinement, combining technical depth with practical usability.
        The app is intended for students, everyday buyers, tech enthusiasts and anyone who feels overwhelmed by technical specifications and uncertain value in second-hand laptop markets.

## 🎯 Purpose and Use Case

Finding a reliable used laptop at a fair price often requires extensive searching, comparison and technical analysis. Many users do not have the experience to judge listings based on titles, vague specifications or outdated hardware naming conventions. LapGenius solves this by analyzing each listing with the help of language models and structuring the result into a scorecard and personalized review.

You can use LapGenius to:

- Browse OLX.ba listings inside the app and view AI-generated summaries
- Evaluate if a laptop is suitable for your workload (study, productivity, gaming, etc.)
- Save devices to favorites and build a short list for later comparison
- Compare two laptops directly and receive a side-by-side analysis with a recommended option
- Track trending listings and best deals via the leaderboard
- Build your own profile with credits, badges, preferences and a favorite brand list
